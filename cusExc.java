//simple custom exception in java
class SimpleCustomException extends Exception {
    //member variable to store our custom message
    String msg;
    SimpleCustomException(String msg) {
        //passing the parameter to the super class constructor
        super(msg);
        this.msg=msg;
    }
    
    //overriding with our custom message
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return msg;
    }
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    try {
	        throw new SimpleCustomException("User-defined exception demonstration");
	    }
	    catch(SimpleCustomException ex) {
	        //calls override toString() method
	        System.out.println(ex);
	        //prints message passed to the super constructor
	        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
	    }
	}
}

Note that the throw keyword has to be inside a try block, and the corresponding exception is caught in a catch block.

Call to the super constructor has to be the first statement inside a constructor.

2.User-Defined Exception for Validating Login Credentials
Consider a use case where we want to validate the login credentials entered by the user and throw an exception with a specific error message or a specific status code to make the user better understand the exception. We can define a custom exception for this case. Let's have a look over it.

//user-defined exception in java
import java.util.*;

//custom exception to validate login credentials
class InvalidCredentialsException extends Exception {
    //member variable to store our custom message
    String msg;
    InvalidCredentialsException(String msg) {
        //passing the parameter to the super class constructor
        super(msg);
        this.msg=msg;
    }
    
    //overriding with our custom message
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return msg;
    }
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    String id = sc.next();
	    String password = sc.next();
	    try {
	        if(id!="user1" || password!="1234"){
	            throw new InvalidCredentialsException("no such user with username - "+id);
	        }
	    }
	    catch(InvalidCredentialsException ex) {
	        //calls override toString() method
	        System.out.println(ex);
	        //prints message passed to the super constructor
	        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
	    }
	}
}


In the above Java program, we've defined a custom exception, InvalidCredentialsException and added our specific error message. In the main method, we've updated the id and password variables with user input. We've put a conditional check to validate the credentials inside a try block, which throws an InvalidCredentialsException if the credentials are not valid. Then we've written a catch block to print our custom exception message.

3.User-Defined Exception for Value Less than Threshold Value
Consider a use case where a value has to be entered by a user or returned by another process, and the value has to be greater than a threshold value; else, we've raised an exception. This exception matches the example case where a user is trying to withdraw some amount, and the amount cannot be negative or zero. Let's have a look over the custom exception for this case in Java.

//user-defined exception in java
import java.util.*;

//custom exception to validate withdrawal amount matches the minimum withdrawal limit
class AmountLessThanRequiredException extends Exception {
    //member variable to store our custom message
    String msg;
    AmountLessThanRequiredException(String msg) {
        //passing the parameter to the super class constructor
        super(msg);
        this.msg=msg;
    }
    
    //overriding with our custom message
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return msg;
    }
}

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    int withdrawAmount = sc.nextInt();
	    try {
	        if(withdrawAmount<=0) { //checking if the amount is greater than zero or not
	            throw new AmountLessThanRequiredException("Entered amount less than minimum withdrawal limit");
	        }
	    }
	    catch(AmountLessThanRequiredException ex) {
	        //calls override toString() method
	        System.out.println(ex);
	        //prints message passed to the super constructor
	        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
	    }
	}
}


In the above java program, we've defined a custom exception, AmountLessThanRequiredException, and added our specific error message. In the main method, we've updated the withdrawAmount variable with user input. We've put a condition to check if the given withdrawal amount is less than or equal to zero inside a try block, which throws an AmountLessThanRequiredException if credentials are not valid. Then we've written a catch block to print our custom exception message.

4. User-defined Exception for Validity of an Entity
Consider a use case where a user is trying to access or log in with expired entity details, for example, a user trying to log in to an application where the provided credentials are no more active. In such a case, a user-defined exception with a custom message helps the user better understand the exception.

Here's the code to do that in Java.

//user-defined exception in java
import java.util.*;

//custom exception to check if the given id is active or not
class IdDoesnotExistException extends Exception {
    //member variable to store our custom message
    String msg;
    IdDoesnotExistException(String msg) {
        //passing the parameter to the super class constructor
        super(msg);
        this.msg=msg;
    }
    
    //overriding with our custom message
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return msg;
    }
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    int id = sc.nextInt();
	    HashSet<Integer> IdList = getIdList(); //returns HashSet with all IDs
	    try {
	        if(!IdList.contains(id)) { //checking if current id is active or not
	            throw new IdDoesnotExistException("Entered id is invalid or no more active");
	        }
	    }
	    catch(IdDoesnotExistException ex) {
	        //calls override toString() method
	        System.out.println(ex);
	        //prints message passed to the super constructor
	        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
	    }
	}
}


In the above java program, we've defined a custom exception, IdDoesnotExistException, and added our specific error message. In the main method, we've updated the id variable with user input. Let's imagine that there's a function named getIdList() which returns a set of all active IDs. We've put an if condition to check if the given id is active inside a try block, which throws an IdDoesnotExistException if the id is not active or invalid. Then we've written a catch block to print our custom exception message.

5.User-defined Exception for Validating the Age of a User
Consider a use case where the user has to input an integer, and the value must be greater than or fit in a range, else we've to raise an exception. This exception matches the example case where the user tries to register for voter ID, which has an age restriction of 18. Let's create a custom exception for this case with a custom message describing the exception.

Let's have a look over the code!

//user-defined exception in java
import java.util.*;

//custom exception to validate age with defined age limit
class AgeDoesNotFitException extends Exception {
    //member variable to store our custom message
    String msg;
    AgeDoesNotFitException(String msg) {
        //passing the parameter to the super class constructor
        super(msg);
        this.msg=msg;
    }
    
    //overriding with our custom message
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return msg;
    }
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    int age = sc.nextInt();
	    try {
	        if(age<18) { //checking if the age is above the limit or not
	            throw new AgeDoesNotFitException("Entered age doesn't fulfill the required age limit");
	        }
	    }
	    catch(AgeDoesNotFitException ex) {
	        //calls override toString() method
	        System.out.println(ex);
	        //prints message passed to the super constructor
	        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
	    }
	}
}


In the above java program, we've defined a custom exception, AgeDoesNotFitException, and added our specific error message. In the main() method, we've updated the age variable with user input. We've put a conditional check to compare the given age with the required age limit inside a try block, which throws an AgeDoesNotFitException if credentials are not valid. Then we've written a catch block to print our custom exception message.

Conclusion
Let's recall

An exception breaks the normal execution flow.
User-defined exceptions provide the flexibility to customize the exception as per our use case.
A custom exception class must extend the Exception class from the java.lang package.
Error message of a custom exception can be configured by passing a message to the super class constructor or by overriding the toString() method.
To use our custom exception, we've to create a new object of the custom exception class and throw it using the throw keyword.
